# mnist-viewer
A simple GUI to view and train a neural network on MNIST using LibTorch (C++ Frontend for PyTorch). This project is primarily to practice all
the tools and features of Qt and PyTorch.

## Compilation
Currently, you have to have Qt, CMake, and MSVC. Use those to compile the project. Then, you can run the mnist-viewer executable.

## Usage
Right now, you can only click through and see really crappy predictions of the different images in the MNIST test dataset. In version 1.0,
you will be able to instruct the system to train to improve accuracy.
